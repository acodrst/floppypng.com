The idea of the Floppy PNG comes from building a [model of a small town of 5,000](https://triples.pub) people facing the crisis of a regional network outage.  I realized that the entire model, including reporting, names, addresses, and diagrams, would fit on something the size of a 1.44MB floppy disk from 1990.  This includes reporting, names, addresses, and diagrams.   Information processing, presentation, data, and compression standards mean that we can have local ubiquitous computing without cloud, and the custom programs and data needed are quite small in size.  This runs counter to how most people imagine computing. The size of a [screenplay](https://triple.pub/#section-7) is much smaller than the finished movie.

A PNG is visual and contained.  It has integrity features. I supplement the included integrity features with a cryptographic signature.
