A Floppy PNG stores data and programs inside a PNG, and provides visual descriptions on the label.  It has several features to assure integrity.  This website archives published Floppy PNG RSA-PSS signatures for verification, as it is dangerous to run code mixed with data, or, for that matter, any code you find on the World Wide Web.
